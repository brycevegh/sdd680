# Abstract
The Tool Upgrade Tracking Business Application is an application that is being designed to give Equipment Engineers the ability to track upgrades on the semiconductor tools that they work on that are used to build the different layers of a microchip. This application will give the ability for the engineers to track what upgrades are available to install on their tools while also giving them the ability to track the upgrades that have already been installed on their tools. The idea of creating this application came from studying how younger and older (more experienced) Equipment Engineers work to track the different upgrades of the tools they work on. From the study it showed that the younger less experienced Equipment Engineers struggled to track the different upgrades that they installed or have available to them to install on their different tools. But the studied showed the main cause of this issue was that the younger engineers just did not have the years under their belt of working on their tools and knowing the tools like the back of their hand. So, creating an application like this has the possibility to bring the younger engineers up to speed by allowing them to get a better feel for their tools and have a resource they can go to when needed. 

The application will need to have a Structured Query Language (SQL) database created so that all the different upgrade data can be stored. Next, the application will need to have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed and the GUI needs to be easy to use so that it is not difficult for engineers to input and view data. This task will include designing different features within the GUI to allow the engineers to add, remove, search, and view the upgrade data that is stored in either of the databases. 

The main accomplishments of this project will be creating a user-friendly application, which entices engineers to want to use the application. This can be done by designing a robust and transparent GUI that comes naturally for the engineers to use with little needed training on how the application works. While also creating the SQL databases to perform all of their complex task in the background of the application where the user will not have to see or initiate these tasks for the application to function correctly. 

# Project Overview & Objectives
## Backgroud 
The project of designing this application is being undertaken because there was room to improve how Equipment Engineers function at semiconductor factories. It was noticed a few of the newer engineers were struggling to keep track of the different tools that they were performing upgrades on, which was due to these engineers being solely responsible for over ten different tools each. With this number of tools, it is understandable how trying to track all the upgrades for over ten different tools can get out of hand quite quickly. This issue led to having conversations with other Equipment Engineers to see how they were handling keeping track of the different upgrades they had installed and are available to install on their tools. From these discussions, it realized all the engineers were doing various ways that were being tried by the younger engineers already. The various different ways of solving these issues that were tried were keeping excel files with the various upgrade information and even trying to keep a notebook where the engineers would track this information. The young engineers found that it was always hard and time intensive to track and find this information even with trying these different methods. Plus, only this information was available to the young engineers due to the information being stored on either their personal computer or notebook. Also, it was found that the other Equipment Engineers used these same methods and were struggling to keep up on the information, or they had just given up all together on trying to track this information. 

## State the Problem
The project problem is that there is not an efficient way for Equipment Engineers to store their tool upgrade data that allows the information to be found easily or accessible within minutes. 

## Objectives
- Create SQL database that can store and retrieve data for the GUI when a user is asking for the information to be inputted or retrieved. 

- Create a functioning GUI that allows the user a way to add and see the data that the SQL database is either inputting or retrieving. 

- Designing the application to be robust with an 85% uptime when running. (Uptime meaning that the application is fully functional and not having issues or some bug within the application.)

- Have a simple design of the GUI, meaning there is minimal number of features (buttons, tab selection, etc.) within the different portions of the GUI. 

- Create levels of control to the application so that different users have different accesses to what they can do within the application. (An example would be having one level that only allows data to be viewed.)

## Challenges
- Designing buttons that can be clicked by the user that trigger functions for the SQL databases to input or retrieve data for the correct databases.

- Figuring out a way to have the data stored in the different SQL databases shown to the user in some window within the GUI.

- Having a learning curve to designing a GUI for the project due to having no experience in developing a GUI ever before. 

## Benefits & Opportunities

### Benefits 
The greatest benefit of the project is that it is providing a useful resource to Equipment Engineers that will allow them to better track available upgrades and what upgrades have been installed on their tools. The application will allow the engineers to pull any information about either what upgrades are installed or what upgrades are available to install within minutes now. Plus, it will allow the engineers to provide upper management with information as to what they have done on their tools so that they can better understand why certain tools may run better than others. While also allowing upper management to better understand how to budget money for the different upgrades and which ones they will want to purchase first. 

### Opportunities
The opportunity that this application gives is that it allows for younger engineers to better understand what upgrades have been installed on their tool, while also giving them the ability to get familiar with what upgrades are available to install on their tools. This is due to how when implementing the application, the engineers will have to perform audits on their tools to determine what upgrades have been installed. With the engineers doing these audits, it will allow them to learn more information on their tools and to get more comfortable with what is going on with their tools. 

## Project Scope
The project is to design a business application that Equipment Engineers will use to track available upgrades and what upgrades have been installed on their tools. With the information for the available upgrades to include what parts are needed for the upgrade, how much the upgrade will cost, and how much time it will take to install the upgrade. In addition, the installed upgrade information will just be a list of all the different upgrades that a specific tool has installed on it. Lastly, below are a few examples of in scope and out of scope features of the business application. 

In Scope Features:
- Allow for different levels of user’s privileges where upper management is only able to view the information and the engineers can make edits and delete information. 

- Create a tab selection button that allows the user to choose which data they want to look at, meaning one tab selection for installed upgrades and a second tab selection for available upgrades. 

- Can make changes to data that is stored in the databases due to possible changes in the information about the upgrade. 
 
Out of Scope Features:
- Having the application track the amount of downtime that the tools are experiencing, and whether the downtime is for preventative maintenance or due to failures on the tool.

- Make the application be able to storage manuals for each of the tool, so that all of this information is all in one place as well. 

- Design the application to accept qualification data from the tool’s qualifications so that trends can be made, and tool efficiency can be determined.
