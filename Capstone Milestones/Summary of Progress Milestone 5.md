# Summary of Progress on Milestone 5

1. All project documentation has been updated with the feedback that has been given by previous instructors. I have also converted all previous milestones to markdown files and uploaded them to my GitHub page in their respective folder.

2. Have at least 50% of the current milestone completed.

3. Summary of your progress on Milestone 5.
	1. The work that is completed is the development of the implementation plan, development of the traceability matrix, adding of the source code listings, adding of comments to what has been changed from the first iteration to the second iteration in the source code listings, development of the test plans and cases, and development of the screencast that demonstrates the applications features for the second iteration.
	
	2.  At this time, I do not have any more work to complete. The only work that will need to be done is the work to make the edits that are needed from the feedback I get from the first submission of Milestone 5.
	
	3. I haven't really encountered any problems with the changes that I have made to the application. The only thing that has been somewhat a problem is that I have had to do research to figure out how to implement some of the changes and this research has taken longer than what I expected.
