# Abstract

The Tool Upgrade Tracking Business Application is being designed to give Equipment Engineers the ability to track upgrades on semiconductor tools that they are responsible for upgrading and maintaining, which the tools they work on build the different layers of microchips. This application will give the engineers a tool they can use to track what upgrades are available to install on their tools and give them the ability to track the upgrades that they already installed on the tools. The idea of this application came from looking at how inexperienced and experienced Equipment Engineers work to track the available and installed upgrades on the tools they are responsible for. From observing these engineers, it showed that the less experienced Equipment Engineers struggled to track this information and that they could not find a method that worked for them. The main point that was taken from watching the engineers was that the inexperienced engineers struggled due to not having the years of experience of working on the tools they are responsible for. Meaning that creating an application like this will help to bring the inexperienced engineers up to speed, allow them to understand what is going on with their tools better, and to understand what resources they have available to them. 

The application design will include the use of a Structured Query Language (SQL) database for storing the available upgrade and installed upgrade data. Next, the application design will include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will allow the user to interact with the data and will be designed to be user-friendly. The design of the GUI will include features that allow the user to initiate tasks that allow the user to add, remove, search, and view the data that is stored in the SQL database. 

The accomplishment of this application is to create a user-friendly application that helps Equipment Engineers on tracking this data. This will be achieved by designing a GUI that is easy to use and navigate while also providing the engineers with training on how to use the features of the application. 

# Design Introduction

The project that is being proposed is to design a business application that Equipment Engineers can use to track the different available and installed upgrades for the tools that they are responsible for. The information that will be tracked for the available upgrades is what parts are needed for the upgrade, how much the upgrade will cost, and how much time it will take to install the upgrade. Then, for the installed upgrades the application will track and organize a list of all the different upgrades that have been installed on each of the tools. Below an Architectural Diagram has been provided for reference to show the physical modules/components of the application are.
