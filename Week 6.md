# Components of Testing
## Part 1

**Stubs**
In the realm of unit testing, managing dependencies is a critical aspect of ensuring that tests are effective, maintainable, and isolated from external factors. Stubs serve as valuable tools when you need to control the indirect input to the unit under test (Tarlinder, 2016-a). Stubs are particularly useful for isolating a unit from its actual dependencies and focusing solely on its core behavior. By acting as stand-ins for real collaborators, stubs return predefined values, effectively mimicking the behavior of the actual collaborators (Tarlinder, 2016-a).

One primary scenario where stubs shine is in controlling the indirect input of the tested object. For instance, if a method of the tested object relies on the output of a collaborator, it's crucial to ensure that the collaborator returns specific values for the test to provide meaningful results (Tarlinder, 2016-a). Stubs come into play in such situations by replacing the actual collaborator with a controlled version, allowing developers to dictate what values the collaborator should provide. This level of control allows unit tests to remain deterministic and reproducible.

For example, suppose we have a class TestedObject that computes a result based on the output of its collaborator. In this scenario, employing a stub for the collaborator allows developers to ensure that the collaborator returns a specific value, enabling them to focus on testing how TestedObject processes that input. This approach helps in isolating and testing the core behavior of TestedObject.

While stubs offer simplicity and ease of use in controlling indirect input, it's essential to avoid overcomplicating them by introducing business logic (Tarlinder, 2016-a). Stubs should remain focused on controlling input values rather than attempting to reproduce the complexness of real collaborators.

**Fakes**

Fakes serve a different purpose compared to stubs. Fakes are lightweight implementations of collaborators that aim to provide self-consistent behavior, offering simplicity and predictability while avoiding the complexities associated with real implementations (Tarlinder, 2016-a).

Unlike stubs, which mainly focus on controlling inputs, fakes are employed when the behavior of a collaborator is essential for testing, but the goal is to avoid having to use the complex collaborators (Tarlinder, 2016-a). Fakes ensure that the unit under test can interact with a collaborator that behaves predictably without introducing unnecessary complexity into the test setup.

For instance, Chapter 12 illustrates a scenario involving a PurchaseWorkflow class that interacts with a PurchaseFacade collaborator. The PurchaseFacade is responsible for various operations like creating purchases and invoices. By using a fake PurchaseFacade, the test can concentrate on verifying the behavior of PurchaseWorkflow without grappling with the intricacies of a real implementation.

Fakes are particularly valuable when dealing with legacy systems or complex components, offering a simplified, controlled alternative to real collaborators (Tarlinder, 2016-a). However, it's crucial to strike a balance and ensure that the fakes accurately represent the necessary behaviors of the real collaborator without introducing unnecessary complexities.

**Mocks**

Mocks, the third type of test double, play a distinct role compared to stubs and fakes. Mock objects are mainly used for verifying indirect outputs and interactions between the portion of code under test and its collaborators (Tarlinder, 2016-a). Mock-based tests are behavior-focused, ensuring that specific methods of the collaborators are called at the right time during the test.

Mocks are particularly useful when the expected outcome of a test is related to the interactions and behaviors of the portion of code under test and its collaborators rather than the codeâ€™s internal state (Tarlinder, 2016-a). Mocks allow developers to track and validate how the code under test interacts with its dependencies.

Consider an example from Chapter 12 involving a PurchaseWorkflow class that interacts with a Campaign collaborator. In this scenario, the test aims to verify that the Campaign's applyDiscount method is being invoked correctly, and the arguments passed to it are correct (Tarlinder, 2016-a). By employing a mock object for the Campaign, the test can explicitly verify these interactions, ensuring that the code under test is functioning correctly.

While mocks offer robust behavior verification and interaction tracking, it's essential to strike a balance between strict verification and test stability. Overly strict mock-based tests can become fragile making them prone to breaking when the code evolves.

**Summary**

In conclusion, Chapter 12 provides valuable insights into three essential kinds of test doubles: stubs, fakes, and mock objects. Stubs are instrumental in controlling indirect input, fakes offer self-consistent implementations of collaborators, and mocks enable behavior verification and interaction tracking. Each type of test double has its distinct use cases and trade-offs, and selecting the right one depends on the specific requirements and goals of your unit tests. By mastering the art of using these test doubles effectively, developers can create robust and maintainable unit tests that ensure the reliability of their software systems.

## Part 2

**State Testing**

State testing primarily focuses on the internal state of an object or system after a specific operation, emphasizing the correctness and consistency of the system's data or properties (Testing [source]). This approach involves the use of test doubles such as stubs and spies to verify the system's state changes. Stubs, for instance, provide predefined responses to method calls, effectively isolating the System Under Test from its dependencies and simulating specific states of collaborators (Testing [source]). In the source, a spy (MailServiceSpy) is employed to observe and record information about the number of messages sent by the mailing service, showcasing the application of state testing principles.

**Behavior Testing**

On the other hand, behavior testing centers around the expected interactions and sequences of method calls between objects or components within the system (Testing [source]). Behavior testing is commonly associated with the use of mock test doubles, which record and validate the interactions between the System Under Test and its dependencies. Mocks are used for behavior verification, ensuring that methods are invoked in the expected order and with the correct arguments (Testing [source]). For instance, in the provided example, a mock (MailServiceMock) is used to verify specific method invocations, such as send, and their order when filling an order object, illustrating the principles of behavior testing.

**Summary**

In summary, state testing is concerned with the internal state of the system, leveraging stubs and spies to observe and verify changes in data or properties. While behavior testing focuses on expected interactions and method call sequences, utilizing mock test doubles for verification. Both approaches play crucial roles in ensuring the reliability and correctness of software systems, offering distinct perspectives on testing objectives and requirements.

## Part 3

**Isolation and Controlled Testing Environments**

Creating stubs and mocks in testing provides the crucial advantage of isolating the code under test from its external dependencies (Tarlinder, 2016-b). In real-world software systems, components often interact with external services, databases, or APIs. However, when conducting tests, relying on these actual collaborators can introduce various challenges. These challenges may include:

- **Dependency Availability:** External dependencies may not always be readily available for testing. They could be offline, undergoing maintenance, or subject to rate limiting, making it difficult to conduct thorough tests.

- **Unpredictable Behavior:** External services and databases can exhibit unpredictable behavior, leading to skewed test results. For example, an external service may return different responses based on its current state.

By replacing these external collaborators with stubs and mocks, testers can create a controlled testing environment where the behavior of the code under test is not influenced by external factors. This controlled environment ensures that tests are reliable, repeatable, and unaffected by the availability or behavior of external services. As a result, testers can focus solely on evaluating the functionality and behavior of the code under test, which is a fundamental aspect of effective testing.

**Enhanced Test Control and Behavior Verification**

Stubs and mocks offer an elevated level of control over the testing process by allowing testers to specify the expected behavior of these test doubles (Tarlinder, 2016-b). This enhanced control is particularly valuable for two key aspects of testing:

- **Setting Expectations with Mocks:** When using mocks, testers can set clear expectations regarding how the code under test should interact with its collaborators. These expectations define the sequence and nature of interactions. For instance, testers can specify that a particular method should be called with specific arguments or that certain methods should be invoked in a particular order.

- **Verifying Interactions:** Mocks also enable the verification of interactions between the code under test and its collaborators. Testers can verify that the expected interactions indeed occur during the test execution. This approach ensures that the code under test correctly interacts with its dependencies as intended.

The ability to set expectations and verify interactions with mocks enhances the precision and thoroughness of testing. Testers can validate that the code adheres to the specified behavior and interactions, providing confidence in the correctness of the software. Furthermore, it aids in the early detection of issues, allowing for prompt resolution during the development process.

**Simplified Testing of Edge Cases and Error Handling**

Testing edge cases and error handling scenarios is a critical aspect of software testing, and stubs and mocks offer a practical and safe means to do so (Tarlinder, 2016-b). Consider the following advantages:

- **Stubs for Simulating Error Conditions:** Testers can configure stubs to return values that simulate error conditions (Tarlinder, 2016-b). For instance, a stub can be set up to return a specific error code or exception when a particular method is called. This capability enables testers to assess how the code under test responds to error scenarios, ensuring that error paths are correctly implemented, and that the system handles exception circumstances.

- **Exception-Throwing Mocks:** Mocks can also be configured to throw exceptions when specific conditions are met. Testers can specify the conditions under which an exception should be thrown, allowing them to evaluate the code's error-handling logic. This approach ensures that the software appropriately handles exception situations, contributing to its robustness and reliability.

Testing edge cases and error handling with stubs and mocks offers several advantages. It provides a controlled environment to deliberately trigger exception conditions, ensuring thorough testing of these critical scenarios. By doing so, testers can identify and address potential issues in error-handling logic, ultimately improving the software's resilience and reliability.

**Summary**

In summary, the use of stubs and mocks in software testing provides essential benefits, including isolation and controlled testing environments, enhanced test control and behavior verification, and simplified testing of edge cases and error handling. These advantages contribute to more effective and comprehensive testing processes, leading to higher software quality and increased confidence in the robustness of the software being developed.
